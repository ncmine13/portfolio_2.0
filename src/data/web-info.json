The purpose of the app is twofold; I aim to provide users with a hassle-free platform to practice mindfulness by consistently answering a set of customizable questions, and to track their mood trends over time. Using technology to reduce the stress surrounding consistent mindfulness-oriented journaling is important to me.",

When I began working on the site, I expanded on inherited code relying on jQuery to manipulate the UI on a front-end data filter. After a company-driven site redesign, I elected to use a JavaScript framework for a more efficient and organized solution to a DOM-manipulation heavy problemspace. Because I'd been hearing good things about Vue, I decided to give it a try.I thoroughly enjoyed learning and practicing a state-management pattern, and am very happy with the fluidity of the UI. ",
